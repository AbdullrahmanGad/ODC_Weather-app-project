# Weather-app Deployment Using Docker, Ansible, and Jenkins:-
This project streamlines the deployment of a Python-based Weather App by leveraging the power of Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible. The automated pipeline integrates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles to ensure smooth and efficient delivery. It begins by automatically fetching the latest updates from a GitHub repository, followed by the creation of a Docker image for the app. This image is then pushed to Docker Hub for easy access and scalability. Finally, using Ansible, the app is seamlessly deployed across virtual machines, ensuring a robust and scalable deployment process. With this setup, the entire application lifecycle—coding, building, testing, and deployment—is automated and optimized.
